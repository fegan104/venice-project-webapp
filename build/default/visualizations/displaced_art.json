  "desc":"The Missing Venice Project Center team created the Missing Venice data visualization in order to preserve the rich history of many 'missing treasures' of Venice, such as pieces of Venetian art that have been scattered around the world, and historically significant buildings that have been destroyed. Users can click on any image of a historical artifact and be directed to a page containing a brief history of the treasure, as well as additional images. Additionally, users can click on the map icon, which brings them to an interactive map, displaying the movement of hidden treasures from Venice to places around the world.<br><br>Click on the floating button in the bottom right-hand corner to <b>check it out!</b>"
